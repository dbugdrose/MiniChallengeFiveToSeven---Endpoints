// MiniChallenge Five to Seven - Endpoints

// Designed an API with 4 endpoints, each with their own corresponding controller and service folder as well as validation.

//Endpoints:

//1. MadLib: accepts multiple inputs and generates a story based on the entered values.

//2. OddOrEven: takes in a numeric input and then displays if the number entered is odd or even.

//3. ReverseIt (Alphanumeric): endpoint that accepts a sequence of numbers and letters then returns a sentence that displays both original and reversed sequences.

//4. ReverseIt (Numbers Only): endpoint that accepts a sequence of only numbers and returns a sentence that displays both original and reversed sequences.

// Peer review: Nicolas Gonzaba-The code looks good for the most part, the only thing is that the Alphanumeric Reverse it requires both letters and numbers, not accepting one or the other alone, which i don't belive is part of the assignmnet.
